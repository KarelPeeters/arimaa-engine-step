/*!
A game engine for the board game [Arimaa](http://arimaa.com/arimaa/). This library
provides the functionality to parse and display board states, generate sets of valid
step based actions as well as take actions on those states.

# Example: Initialize a new game state.

A new game state can be initialized from the GameState

```
use arimaa_engine_step::GameState;

let game_state = GameState::initial();

println!("{}", game_state);
```
# Example: Parsing game states and actions.

A game state can also be read from a string as well as actions.

```
use arimaa_engine_step::{action, board};

let game_state = board!(
    "2g
     +-----------------+
    8| h c d m e d c h |
    7| r r r r r r r r |
    6|     x     x     |
    5|                 |
    4|                 |
    3|     x     x     |
    2| R R R R R R R R |
    1| H C D M E D C H |
     +-----------------+
       a b c d e f g h"
);

let action = action!(d2n);
let game_state = game_state.take_action(&action);
```
# Example: Generate valid steps

A game state can be used to generate a valid list of actions. These actions are based on a list of valid steps.

```
use arimaa_engine_step::{action, board};

let game_state = board!("
    2g
     +-----------------+
    8|           r     |
    7|                 |
    6|   R x   e x     |
    5|                 |
    4|                 |
    3|     x     x     |
    2|                 |
    1|                 |
     +-----------------+
       a b c d e f g h");

let valid_actions = game_state.valid_actions();

assert_eq!(&[action!(b6n), action!(b6e), action!(b6w)], &*valid_actions);
```

# Example: Detect terminals

A game state can be used to determine if a terminal state has been reached.

```
use arimaa_engine_step::{Terminal, board, take_actions};

let game_state = board!("
    2g
     +-----------------+
    8|           r     |
    7|                 |
    6|   R x   e x     |
    5|                 |
    4|                 |
    3|     x     x     |
    2|                 |
    1|                 |
     +-----------------+
       a b c d e f g h");

assert_eq!(game_state.is_terminal(), None);

let game_state = take_actions!(game_state => b6n, b7n, p);

assert_eq!(game_state.is_terminal(), Some(Terminal::GoldWin));
```

# Example: Generate moves

Generate a full set of unique moves.

            moves.push((actions, new_game_state));
            continue;
        }

        // A full move has not been reached, it is not terminal and it is still the same players turn.
        // Recurse to check the next set of valid steps in the move.

    println!("{}: {:?}", i, actions);
}

# Example: Create a plane out of piece board bits

Creates a slice for a 8x8 board that would be used as an input plane for a neural network by taking
the bits from the piece board plane and setting those matching bits into an array.
